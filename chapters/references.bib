  abstract = {Temporal Summarization ({TS}) is a new track introduced as part of the Text {REtrieval} Conference ({TREC}) in 2013. This track aims to develop systems which can return important updates related to an event over time. In {TREC} 2013, the {TS} track specifically used disaster related events such as earthquake, hurricane, bombing, etc. This thesis mainly focuses on building an effective {TS} system by using a combination of Information Retrieval techniques. The developed {TS} system returns updates related to disaster related events in a timely manner.

By participating in {TREC} 2013 and with experiments conducted after {TREC}, we examine the effectiveness of techniques such as distributional similarity for term expansion, which can be employed in building {TS} systems. Also, this thesis describes the effectiveness of other techniques such as stemming, adaptive sentence selection over time and de-duplication in our system, by comparing it with other baseline systems. 

The second part of the thesis examines the current methodology used for evaluating {TS} systems. We propose a modified evaluation method which could reduce the manual effort of assessors, and also correlates well with the official track’s evaluation. We also propose a supervised learning based evaluation method, which correlates well with the official track’s evaluation of systems and could save the assessor’s time by as much as 80\%.},

We call this type of search Query Document Search. In this type of search, the initial query document is typically long and contains diverse aspects (or sub-topics). Users tend to issue many queries based on the initial document to retrieve relevant documents. To help users in this situation, we propose a method to suggest diverse queries that can cover multiple aspects of the query document. We first identify multiple query aspects and then provide diverse query suggestions that are effective for retrieving relevant documents as well being related to more query aspects. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is effective in comparison to previous query suggestion methods.},

We present a systematic approach to diversifying results that aims to minimize the risk of dissatisfaction of the average user. We propose an algorithm that well approximates this objective in general, and is provably optimal for a natural special case. Furthermore, we generalize several classical {IR} metrics, including {NDCG}, {MRR}, and {MAP}, to explicitly account for the value of diversification. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm scores higher in these generalized metrics compared to results produced by commercial search engines.},

We consider a result list most diverse, with respect to some set of topics related to the query, when the number of documents it provides on each topic is proportional to the topic's popularity. Consequently, we propose a framework for optimizing proportionality for search result diversification, which is motivated by the problem of assigning seats to members of competing political parties. Our technique iteratively determines, for each position in the result ranked list, the topic that best maintains the overall proportionality. It then selects the best document on this topic for this position. We demonstrate empirically that our method significantly outperforms the top performing approach in the literature not only on our proposed metric for proportionality, but also on several standard diversity measures. This result indicates that promoting proportionality naturally leads to minimal redundancy, which is a goal of the current diversity approaches.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework for Web search result diversification, which explicitly accounts for the various aspects associated to an underspecified query. In particular, we diversify a document ranking by estimating how well a given document satisfies each uncovered aspect and the extent to which different aspects are satisfied by the ranking as a whole. We thoroughly evaluate our framework in the context of the diversity task of the {TREC} 2009 Web track. Moreover, we exploit query reformulations provided by three major Web search engines ({WSEs}) as a means to uncover different query aspects. The results attest the effectiveness of our framework when compared to state-of-the-art diversification approaches in the literature. Additionally, by simulating an upper-bound query reformulation mechanism from official {TREC} data, we draw useful insights regarding the effectiveness of the query reformulations generated by the different {WSEs} in promoting diversity.},

Starting from the hypothesis that data fusion can improve performance in terms of diversity metrics, we examine the impact of standard data fusion methods on result diversification. We take the output of a set of rankers, optimized for diversity or not, and find that data fusion can significantly improve state-of-the art diversification methods. We also introduce a new data fusion method, called diversified data fusion, which infers latent topics of a query using topic modeling, without leveraging outside information. Our experiments show that data fusion methods can enhance the performance of diversification and {DDF} significantly outperforms existing data fusion methods in terms of diversity metrics.},

  abstract = {Search result diversification has gained momentum as a way to tackle ambiguous queries. An effective approach to this problem is to explicitly model the possible aspects underlying a query, in order to maximise the estimated relevance of the retrieved documents with respect to the different aspects. However, such aspects themselves may represent information needs with rather distinct intents (e.g., informational or navigational). Hence, a diverse ranking could benefit from applying intent-aware retrieval models when estimating the relevance of documents to different aspects. In this paper, we propose to diversify the results retrieved for a given query, by learning the appropriateness of different retrieval models for each of the aspects underlying this query. Thorough experiments within the evaluation framework provided by the diversity task of the {TREC} 2009 and 2010 Web tracks show that the proposed approach can significantly improve state-of-the-art diversification approaches.},

Most existing methods on this problem utilize a heuristic predefined ranking function, where limited features can be incorporated and extensive tuning is required for different settings. In this paper, we address search result diversification as a learning problem, and introduce a novel relational learning-to-rank approach to formulate the task. However, the definitions of ranking function and loss function for the diversification problem are challenging. In our work, we firstly show that diverse ranking is in general a sequential selection process from both empirical and theoretical aspects. On this basis, we define ranking function as the combination of relevance score and diversity score between the current document and those previously selected, and loss function as the likelihood loss of ground truth based on Plackett-Luce model, which can naturally model the sequential generation of a diverse ranking list. Stochastic gradient descent is then employed to conduct the unconstrained optimization, and the prediction of a diverse ranking list is provided by a sequential selection process based on the learned ranking function. The experimental results on the public {TREC} datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.},

In this article, we propose a ranking approach for producing effective query suggestions. In particular, we devise a structured representation of candidate suggestions mined from a query log that leverages evidence from other queries with a common session or a common click. This enriched representation not only helps overcome data sparsity for long-tail queries, but also leads to multiple ranking criteria, which we integrate as features for learning to rank query suggestions. To validate our approach, we build upon existing efforts for web search evaluation and propose a novel framework for the quantitative assessment of query suggestion effectiveness. Thorough experiments using publicly available data from the {TREC} Web track show that our approach provides effective suggestions for adhoc and diversity search.},

In this paper, we argue that search results should be diversified in a multi-dimensional way, as queries are usually ambiguous at different levels and dimensions. We first explore mining subtopics from four types of data sources, including anchor texts, query logs, search result clusters, and web sites. Then we propose a general framework that explicitly diversifies search results based on multiple dimensions of subtopics. It balances the relevance of documents with respect to the query and the novelty of documents by measuring the coverage of subtopics. Experimental results on the {TREC} 2009 Web track dataset indicate that combining multiple types of subtopics do help better understand user intents. By incorporating multiple types of subtopics, our models improve the diversity of search results over the sole use of one of them, and outperform two state-of-the-art models.},

Our results show that existing diversification approaches based solely on novelty cannot consistently improve over a standard, non-diversified baseline ranking. Moreover, when deployed as an additional component by the current state-of-the-art diversification approaches, our results show that novelty does not bring significant improvements, while adding considerable efficiency overheads. Finally, through a comprehensive analysis with simulated rankings of various quality, we demonstrate that, although inherently limited by the performance of the initial ranking, novelty plays a role at breaking the tie between similarly diverse results.},

Our results in the context of the diversity task of the {TREC} 2009 and 2010 Web tracks show that diversity metrics are not necessarily better suited for guiding a learning approach. Moreover, the suitability of these metrics is compromised as they try to penalise redundancy during the learning process.},

With current approaches the top results for these queries tend to be homogeneous, making it difficult for users interested in less popular aspects to find relevant documents. While existing research in search diversification offers several solutions for introducing variety into the results, the majority of such work is predicated, implicitly or otherwise, on the assumption that a single relevant document will fulfill a user's information need, making them inadequate for many informational queries. In this paper we present a search-diversification algorithm particularly suitable for informational queries by explicitly modeling that the user may need more than one page to satisfy their need. This modeling enables our algorithm to make a well-informed tradeoff between a user's desire for multiple relevant documents, probabilistic information about an average user's interest in the subtopics of a multifaceted query, and uncertainty in classifying documents into those subtopics. We evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm against commercial search engine results and other modern ranking strategies, demonstrating notable improvement in multiple document scenarios.},

However, current evaluation techniques disregard the fact that users continue to rate items over time: the temporal characteristics of the system's top-N recommendations are not investigated. In particular, there is no means of measuring the extent that the same items are being recommended to users over and over again. In this work, we show that temporal diversity is an important facet of recommender systems, by showing how {CF} data changes over time and performing a user survey. We then evaluate three {CF} algorithms from the point of view of the diversity in the sequence of recommendation lists they produce over time. We examine how a number of characteristics of user rating patterns (including profile size and time between rating) affect diversity. We then propose and evaluate set methods that maximise temporal recommendation diversity without extensively penalising accuracy.},

The implicit approach assumes each document represents its own topic, and promotes diversity by selecting documents for different topics based on the difference of their vocabulary. On the other hand, the explicit approach models the set of query topics, or aspects. While the former approach is generally less effective, the latter usually depends on a manually created description of the query aspects, the automatic construction of which has proven difficult. This paper introduces a new approach: term-level diversification. Instead of modeling the set of query aspects, which are typically represented as coherent groups of terms, our approach uses terms without the grouping. Our results on the {ClueWeb} collection show that the grouping of topic terms provides very little benefit to diversification compared to simply using the terms themselves. Consequently, we demonstrate that term-level diversification, with topic terms identified automatically from the search results using a simple greedy algorithm, significantly outperforms methods that attempt to create a full topic structure for diversification.},
