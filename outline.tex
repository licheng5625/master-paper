\title{Outline: Real time rumor debunking in twitter	}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction - (5 pages)}
	Motivations of rumor debunking system like the one rumor of Obama made the stock down. Twitter is anonymous and the information on twitter spreads faster and wider than the traditional media. So a real time rumor detecting system is helpful. 

	\subsection{Research Questions - (1 - 1.5 pages)}
	Each of these correspond to a core chapter in the thesis.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{definition of rumor}

			\item{general rumors detecting not rumor in some special events}
			\item{real time single tweet credibility system}
			\item{time series model rumor detecting}
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Contributions and Publications - (1 page)}
		List contributions as solutions to the research questions and the correspoinding publications.
	\subsection{Outline of Thesis (0.5 page max)}

	\subsection{Summary}
		%TODO: a) need experiments with more queries for the UKGOV dataset. Currently we have an evaluation over 50 queries. Extend it to 300 queries. b) need experiments for entire index build times. We currently have partial indexes containing query terms only in the test workload. (Do we need this given we do warm-cache measurements).
		
		%TODO: profile the updation of the sharded index with complete recomputation.
