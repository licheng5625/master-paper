I am dedicating this thesis to my parents. They have been strong and supportive
of my choices during my masters and have pushed me to work harder everyday. I am 
very grateful to my mentor Dr. Avishek Anand for helping me across the finish line
and helping me make defining career choices. My sincere gratitude to Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Nejdl
for having faith in me and guiding me through my bachelors and masters. A big thank you to
the LearnWeb team including Dr. Ivana Marenzi for giving me a project to contribute towards.
I am especially grateful to M. Sc. Sergej Zerr for taking me under his wing when I first arrived and 
I owe a lot of what I have learned to him. A special mention to the ITIS program for
providing international students like me a world-class education.
Last but not the least, to my friends - Pragyan, Zeon, Saniya, Rohit, Irene
and the others who have helped me through good times and bad.

Without you all my masters would not have been a success.
