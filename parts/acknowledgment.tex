Firstly, I want to thank my parents. Without their support, I can't finish my master study in a foreign country. 
 
I am very grateful to my mentor M.Sc. Tu Nguyen who gave me lots of help and inspiration in master thesis.

I also want to thank Dr. Tuan Anh Hoang who gave me lots of useful advises.

Last but not least, I want to thank my girlfriend for accompanying me through all the hard and good time.

Without you all my master study would not have been a success.
